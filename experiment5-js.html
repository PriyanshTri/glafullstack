      JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/)[9], often abbreviated as JS, is a
      programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[10]
      JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.
      It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based
      object-orientation, and first-class functions. Alongside HTML and CSS,
      JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[11] Over
      97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,[12] often
      incorporating third-party libraries.[13] Most web browsers have a
      dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.
